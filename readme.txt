<h2><strong>Why testimonials are highly important</strong></h2>
"In a networked world trust is the most important currency." — Eric Schmidt, Chairman of Google
"88% Of Consumers Trust Online Reviews As Much As Personal Recommendations." - BrightLocal
"72% of consumers will take action after reading a positive review.” - BrightLocal

= eTrusted: Get Better Testimonials =

Trust, security and transparency are vital for success not only in the online world but also for local businesses. People are more likely to buy from those they trust and if consumers can't trust a business, they will go elsewhere. When people start reading testimonials they have already established their ‘need’ and which business can meet it; now they’re looking for positive signals to help them decide which competitor they trust most. If they don’t get a personal recommendation from a friend or family, they will most likely search the internet for testimonials. And this is precisely where eTrusted can help you. By using the Trustbadge Testimonials solution, you make it easy for your customers, clients or business partners to just leave a recommendation directly on your website. New customers can see that you’re trustworthy on your site viea the testimonials or by visiting your profile. This improves your ranking in search engines (SEO), demonstrates your trustworthiness by a trustworthy third party and you neither need to manually upload recommendations nor require any technical knowledge.
